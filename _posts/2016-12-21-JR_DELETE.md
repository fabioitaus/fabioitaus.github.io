Abstract:

The Academy has announced the recipients of the J G Russell Award to help talented younger researchers in the basic sciences.

The four awardees are working towards cheaper solar cells, understanding brain plasticity, harnessing self-assembling molecules for manufacturing and employing computers to help make sense of the waves of data coming from modern biology.

Each researcher receives $6000 towards the costs of equipment, maintenance and travel as a top up to their Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Awards, supported by the generosity of the late Miss J Russell.

Dr Pengyi Yang from the University of Sydney is employing machine learning to help find links between the studies of separate biological processes, such as epigenetics and protein and metabolic processes.
