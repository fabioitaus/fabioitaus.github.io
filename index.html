About me

I am an Associate Professor at the School of Medical Science, and I am a team leader at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity.
I hold an NHMRC Research Fellow (CDF2) and I have a visiting fellowship position at the Garvan institute.
I am a theoretical biologist with a strong interdisciplinary background. 
My training has been in the areas of Physics, Biology, Statistics, Immunology, and Virology,
and I have developed skills in computational biology, bioinformatics, theoretical immunology, 
and evolutionary dynamics of pathogens. 

My research focusses on Systems Immunology. I obtained a PhD degree in Theoretical Immunology and Biophysics (2006) from the 
Humboldt University of Berlin (Germany). He trained as theoretical physicist (Masters, Bologna University Italy)
and theoretical biologist (PhD), to then move to Australia as postdoctoral researcher in mathematical modeling of
infectious diseases. In 2008 he was awarded an NHMRC Postdoctoral Training Fellow and conducted successfully 
interdisciplinary research across mathematical modeling, Bioinformatics, Statistics, Virology, and Immunology.
