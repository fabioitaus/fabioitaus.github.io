Fabio Luciani, Ph.D., leads the <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-fabio-luciani"> Immunogenomics</a> group at the Kirby Institute and School of Medical Sciences,
at the University of New South Wales,
and is Associate professor at the School of Medical Sciences, UNSW Sydney.
<br><br>

We develop computational and statistical models to reconstruct cell signalling, 
epigenomic/transcriptional, and proteomic networks, and characterise their cross-talk and trans-regulations in various 
cellular processes and systems. By integrating heterogeneous trans-omic data with the goal of generating testable hypotheses 
and predictions, we aim to tackle the following research questions:<br><br>

<ul>
	<li>How do different layers of regulations talk to each other in controlling stem cell fate?</li>
    <li>Can we accurately predict stem cell differentiation trajectories based on their TRNs?</li>
    <li>The mechanisms of stem/progenitor cells in establishing identities and making cell fate decisions</li>
</ul>

    <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
    <p> 
      I am an Associate Professor at the School of Medical Science, 
and I am a team leader at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity. 
I hold an NHMRC Research Fellow (CDF2) and I have a visiting fellowship position at the Garvan institute. 
I am a theoretical biologist with a strong interdisciplinary background. My training has been in the areas of Physics,
Biology, Statistics, Immunology, and Virology, and I have developed skills in computational biology, bioinformatics,
theoretical immunology, and evolutionary dynamics of pathogens. My research focusses on Systems Immunology. 
I obtained a PhD degree in Theoretical Immunology and Biophysics (2006) from the Humboldt University of Berlin (Germany).
I trained as theoretical physicist (Masters, Bologna University Italy) and theoretical biologist (PhD),
to then move to Australia as postdoctoral researcher in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. 
In 2008 I was awarded an NHMRC Postdoctoral Training Fellow and conducted successfully interdisciplinary 
research across mathematical modeling, Bioinformatics, Statistics, Virology, and Immunology.

<b>Openings</b><br><br>

Our lab is multi-disciplinary and combines immunology, bioinformatics, mathematics and statistics, and molecular biology for
understanding how immune cells respond to pathogens and cancer.
<br><br>
 PhD and Honours candidates are welcome to join us and work on either
'wet' (laboratory) or 'dry' (computational) projects (or both). 
<br><br>
PhD Scholarships are available for international candidates. Summer Research Scholarships are available for third year undergraduates. For more details regarding scholarships, please contact Associate Professor Fabio Luciani (<a href="mailto:luciani@unsw.edu.au">luciani [at] unsw.edu.au</a>)
